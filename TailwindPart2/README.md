# ðŸŒŸ Tailwind CSS Learning Roadmap

This document outlines my personal roadmap for learning and mastering **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

---

## âœ… Things to Learn

1. **Transitions & Animations**  
   - Learn how to add smooth transitions on hover/focus using `transition`, `duration`, `ease`, etc.
   - Explore Tailwindâ€™s built-in animation utilities.

2. **Creating Sidebars**  
   - Build fixed or collapsible sidebars using Flexbox/Grid.
   - Make them responsive and interactive.

3. **CSS Positioning**  
   - Understand and apply `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`.
   - Use positioning in real layout examples.

4. **Completing UI Designs**  
   - Practice turning full UI mockups (like from Figma) into Tailwind-based designs.
   - Focus on spacing, responsiveness, and pixel-perfect accuracy.

5. **Dark Mode & Hover Effects**  
   - Use `dark:` variants to add dark mode styling.
   - Add interactive styles using `hover:`, `focus:`, and `active:` pseudo-classes.
